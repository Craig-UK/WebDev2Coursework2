# WebDev2Coursework2
Restaurant Website using Nodejs, Express and Mustache (View Engine) for Web Application Development 2 Coursework 2.
## How to start the Web Application
Here's how to start the Web Application on your local machine:
###### Start by installing the required node modules
```
npm install
```
###### After all required modules have been installed, run one of these commands to start the Web Application
```
npm run start
```
Or
```
node index.js
```
## Justification for changes from original development plans
###### Customer Login/Customer Register
In the original development plans for the Web Application, there was a customer login and customer register
pages. I then realised, after feedback, that these pages were unnecessary, so they are no longer being added
to the final Web Application.
## Todo

- [x] Staff can access all pages and instead of login, the navbar shows "logout" when staff are logged in
- [x] Add the add new dish functionality
