# WebDev2Coursework2
Restaurant Website using Nodejs, Express and Mustache (View Engine) for Web Application Development 2 Coursework 2.
## How to start the website
Here's how to start the website on your local machine:
###### Start by installing the required node modules
```
npm install
```
###### After all required modules have been installed, run this command to start the website
```
npm run start
```
Or
```
node index.js
```
## Justification from changes from original development plans
###### Customer Login/Customer Register
In the original development plans for the website, there was a customer login and customer register
pages. I then realised, after feedback, that these pages were unnecessary, so they are no longer being added
to the final website.
## Todo

- [x] Staff can access all pages and instead of login, the navbar shows "logout" when staff are logged in
- [ ] Add the add new dish functionality
- [ ] Show dish types under the correct headings (e.g. Starters, Main Coures, etc.)

- [ ] Add single dish page with more details of the selected dish
- [ ] Create the edit lunch function
- [ ] Create the edit dinner function
